	abstract = {In this article, we model the volcanism near the proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, U.S.A. by estimating the instantaneous recurrence rate using a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with Weibull intensity and by using a homogeneous Poisson process to predict future eruptions. We then quantify the probability that any single eruption is disruptive in terms of a (prior) probability distribution, since not every eruption would result in disruption of the repository. Bayesian analysis is performed to evaluate the volcanic risk. Based on the Quaternary data, a 90\% confidence interval for the instantaneous recurrence rate near the Yucca Mountain site is (1.85×10−6/yr, 1.26×10−5/yr). Also, using-these confidence bounds, the corresponding 90\% confidence interval for the risk (probability of at least one disruptive eruption) for an isolation time of 104 years is (1.0×10−3, 6.7×10−3), if it is assumed that the intensity remains constant during the projected time frame.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The proposed area of most recent volcanism ({AMRV}) includes all known post-6 Ma volcanic complexes in the Yucca Mountain area and encompasses the four volcanic centers in Crater Flat, the Lathrop Wells cone, several centers in southeast Crater Flat, two centers at Sleeping Butte, and a center at Buckboard Mesa within the moat of the Timber Mountain Caldera. The delineation of high-risk zones for volcanism within the {AMRV} is an important goal in any risk assessment study. The dimensions and orientation of high-risk zones were based on structural and volcanic chain length data obtained by detailed studies of Plio-Pleistocene volcanic centers in the Yucca Mountain area. Analog studies of Pliocene volcanic centers in the Fortification Hill field (Lake Mead area, Arizona and Nevada) and the Reveille Range (south-central Nevada) were also used to establish the nature of structural control of volcanic vents and to determine the lengths of volcanic chains. Two high-risk rectangles were constructed at each cluster of Quaternary centers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The scenario in a risk analysis can be defined as the propagating feature of specific initiating event which can go to a wide range of undesirable consequences. If we take various scenarios into consideration, the risk analysis becomes more complex than do without them. A lot of risk analyses have been performed to actually estimate a risk profile under both uncertain future states of hazard sources and undesirable scenarios. Unfortunately, in case of considering specific systems such as a radioactive waste disposal facility, since the behaviour of future scenarios is hardly predicted without special reasoning process, we cannot estimate their risk only with a traditional risk analysis methodology. Moreover, we believe that the sources of uncertainty at future states can be reduced pertinently by setting up dependency relationships interrelating geological, hydrological, and ecological aspects of the site with all the scenarios. It is then required current methodology of uncertainty analysis of the waste disposal facility be revisited under this belief. In order to consider the effects predicting from an evolution of environmental conditions of waste disposal facilities, this paper proposes a quantitative assessment framework integrating the inference process of Bayesian network to the traditional probabilistic risk analysis. We developed and verified an approximate probabilistic inference program for the specific Bayesian network using a bounded-variance likelihood weighting algorithm. Ultimately, specific models, including a model for uncertainty propagation of relevant parameters were developed with a comparison of variable-specific effects due to the occurrence of diverse altered evolution scenarios ({AESs}). After providing supporting information to get a variety of quantitative expectations about the dependency relationship between domain variables and {AESs}, we could connect the results of probabilistic inference from the Bayesian network with the consequence evaluation model addressed. We got a number of practical results to improve current knowledge base for the prioritization of future risk-dominant variables in an actual site.},

	abstract = {This paper summarizes the evolution of the engineered barrier design for the proposed Yucca Mountain disposal system. Initially, the underground facility used a fairly standard panel and drift layout excavated mostly by drilling and blasting. By 1993, the layout of the underground facility was changed to accommodate construction by a tunnel boring machine. Placement of the repository in unsaturated zone permitted an extended period without backfilling; placement of the waste package in an open drift permitted use of much larger, and thus hotter packages. Hence in 1994, the underground facility design switched from floor emplacement of waste in small, single walled stainless steel or nickel alloy containers to in-drift emplacement of waste in large, double-walled containers. By 2000, the outer layer was a high nickel alloy for corrosion resistance and the inner layer was stainless steel for structural strength. Use of large packages facilitated receipt and disposal of high volumes of spent nuclear fuel. In addition, in-drift package placement saved excavation costs. Options considered for in-drift emplacement included different heat loads and use of backfill. To avoid dripping on the package during the thermal period and the possibility of localized corrosion, titanium drip shields were added for the disposal drifts by 2000. In addition, a handling canister, sealed at the reactor to eliminate further handling of bare fuel assemblies, was evaluated and eventually adopted in 2006. Finally, staged development of the underground layout was adopted to more readily adjust to changes in waste forms and Congressional funding.},

	abstract = {A simple Poisson process is more specifically known as a homogeneous Poisson process since the rateλ was assumed independent of time t. The homogeneous Poisson model generally gives a good fit to many volcanoes for forecasting volcanic eruptions. If eruptions occur according to a homogeneous Poisson process, the repose times between consecutive eruptions are independent exponential variables with meanθ=1/λ. The exponential distribution is applicable when the eruptions occur “at random” and are not due to aging, etc. It is interesting to note that a general population of volcanoes can be related to a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with intensity factorλ(t). In this paper, specifically, we consider a more general Weibull distribution, {WEI} (θ, β), for volcanism. A Weibull process is appropriate for three types of volcanoes: increasing-eruption-rate (β{\textgreater}1), decreasing-eruption-rate (β{\textless}1), and constant-eruption-rate (β=1). Statistical methods (parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and prediction intervals) are provided to analyze the following five volcanoes: Also, Etna, Kilauea, St. Helens, and Yake-Dake. We conclude that the generalized model can be considered a goodness-of-fit test for a simple exponential model (a homogeneous Poisson model), and is preferable for practical use for some nonhomogeneous Poisson volcanoes with monotonic eruptive rates.},

	abstract = {Forecasting is a central goal of volcanology. Intensive monitoring of recent eruptions has generated integrated time-series of data, which have resulted in several successful examples of warnings being issued on impending eruptions. Ability to forecast is being advanced by new technology, such as broad-band seismology, satellite observations of ground deformation and improved field spectrometers for volcanic gas studies, and spectacular advances in computer power and speed, leading to improvements in data transmission, data analysis and modelling techniques. Analytical studies of volcanic samples, experimental investigations and theoretical modelling are providing insights into the dynamics of magmatic systems, giving a physical framework with which to interpret volcanic phenomena. Magmas undergo profound changes in physical properties as pressure and temperature vary during magma chamber evolution, magma ascent and eruption. Degassing and cooling during magma ascent induce crystallisation and increases of viscosity, strength and compressibility, commonly by several orders of magnitude. Active magmatic systems also interact strongly with their surroundings, causing ground deformation, material failure and other effects such as disturbed groundwater systems and degassing. These processes and interactions lead to geophysical and phenomenological effects, which precede and accompany eruptions. Forecasting of hazardous volcanic phenomena is becoming more quantitative and based on understanding of the physics of the causative processes. Forecasting is evolving from empirical pattern recognition to forecasting based on models of the underlying dynamics. The coupling of highly non-linear and complex kinetic and dynamic processes leads to a rich range of behaviours. Due to intrinsic uncertainties and the complexity of non-linear systems, precise prediction is usually not achievable. Forecasts of eruptions and hazards need to be expressed in probabilistic terms that take account of uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Estimation of potential radionuclide releases from the waste package subsystem of a nuclear waste repository is required for two reasons: (a) to judge whether the engineered barrier system complies with the performance regulations prescribed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and (b) to provide radionuclide source terms needed to predict the isolation performance of the natural barriers (i.e., geologic medium), which must be compared with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency safety standard.A probabilistic approach developed at the Basalt Waste Isolation Project ({BWIP}) for the estimation of radionuclide releases from a proposed nuclear waste repository in basalt is presented. The central idea of this approach is that uncertainties in both the radionuclide transport parameters and the random nature of container failures impact the estimation of release rates. Details of the method are provided that account for both sources of uncertainty. Sample applications are presented that are based on preliminary data.Briefly, the {BWIP} methodology consists of (a) a container corrosion model, (b) a model describing the random sequence of container failures in time, (c) a stochastic transport model to obtain the probability distribution of releases from a single container failing at a specified time, and (d) a model to integrate the releases from the randomly failing containers in the repository.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic seismic hazard analyses were conducted to estimate both ground motion and fault displacement hazards at the potential geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel and high‐level radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The study is believed to be the largest and most comprehensive analyses ever conducted for ground‐shaking hazard and is a first‐of‐a‐kind assessment of probabilistic fault displacement hazard. The major emphasis of the study was on the quantification of epistemic uncertainty. Six teams of three experts performed seismic source and fault displacement evaluations, and seven individual experts provided ground motion evaluations. State‐of‐the‐practice expert elicitation processes involving structured workshops, consensus identification of parameters and issues to be evaluated, common sharing of data and information, and open exchanges about the basis for preliminary interpretations were implemented. Ground‐shaking hazard was computed for a hypothetical rock outcrop at ‐300 m, the depth of the potential waste emplacement drifts, at the designated design annual exceedance probabilities of 10‐3 and 10‐4. The fault displacement hazard was calculated at the design annual exceedance probabilities of 10‐4 and 10‐5.},

This paper is the first in a series that will examine the probability of disruption of the Yucca Mountain site by volcanic eruption. In it, we discuss three estimating techniques for determining the recurrence rate of volcanic eruption (λ), an important parameter in the Poisson probability model. The first method is based on the number of events occurring over a certain observation period, the second is based on repose times, and the final is based on magma volume. All three require knowledge of the total number of eruptions in the Yucca Mountain area during the observation period (E). Following this discussion we then propose an estimate of E which takes into account the possibility of polygenetic and polycyclic volcanism at all the volcanic centers near the Yucca Mountain site.},

The procedure is based on a Bayesian approach that produces a probability estimation of any possible event in which we are interested and can make use of all available information including theoretical models, historical and geological data, and monitoring observations. The main steps in the procedure are (1) to estimate an a priori probability distribution based upon theoretical knowledge, (2) to modify that using past data, and (3) to modify it further using current monitoring data. The scheme allows epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties to be dealt with in a formal way, through estimation of probability distributions at each node of the event tree. We then describe an application of the method to the case of Mount Vesuvius. Although the primary intent of the example is to illustrate the methodology, one result of this application merits special mention. The present emergency response plan for Mount Vesuvius is referenced to a maximum expected event ({MEE}), the largest out of all the possible eruptions within the next few decades. Our calculation suggest that there is a nonnegligible (1–20\%) chance that the next eruption could be larger than that stipulated in the present {MEE}. The methodology allows all assumptions and thresholds to be clearly identified and provides a rational means for their revision if new data or information are obtained.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a method using probabilistic risk analysis for application to corrosion associated failures in grey cast iron water mains. External corrosion reduces the capacity of the pipeline to resist stresses. When external stresses exceed the residual ultimate strength, pipe breakage becomes imminent, and the overall reliability of a water distribution network is reduced. Modelling stresses and external corrosion acting on a pipe involves uncertainties inherent in the mechanistic/statistical models and their input parameters. Monte Carlo ({MC}) simulations were used to perform the probabilistic analysis. The reduction in the factor of safety ({FOS}) of water mains over time was computed, with a failure defined as a situation in which {FOS} becomes smaller than 1. The {MC} simulations yielded an empirical probability density function of time to failure, to which a lognormal distribution was fitted leading to the derivation of a failure hazard function. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the contribution of corrosion parameters to the variability of time to failure was more significant than the combined contributions of all other parameters. Areas where more research is needed are identified.},
