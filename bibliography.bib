	abstract = {In this article, we model the volcanism near the proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, U.S.A. by estimating the instantaneous recurrence rate using a nonhomogeneous Poisson process with Weibull intensity and by using a homogeneous Poisson process to predict future eruptions. We then quantify the probability that any single eruption is disruptive in terms of a (prior) probability distribution, since not every eruption would result in disruption of the repository. Bayesian analysis is performed to evaluate the volcanic risk. Based on the Quaternary data, a 90\% confidence interval for the instantaneous recurrence rate near the Yucca Mountain site is (1.85×10−6/yr, 1.26×10−5/yr). Also, using-these confidence bounds, the corresponding 90\% confidence interval for the risk (probability of at least one disruptive eruption) for an isolation time of 104 years is (1.0×10−3, 6.7×10−3), if it is assumed that the intensity remains constant during the projected time frame.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The proposed area of most recent volcanism ({AMRV}) includes all known post-6 Ma volcanic complexes in the Yucca Mountain area and encompasses the four volcanic centers in Crater Flat, the Lathrop Wells cone, several centers in southeast Crater Flat, two centers at Sleeping Butte, and a center at Buckboard Mesa within the moat of the Timber Mountain Caldera. The delineation of high-risk zones for volcanism within the {AMRV} is an important goal in any risk assessment study. The dimensions and orientation of high-risk zones were based on structural and volcanic chain length data obtained by detailed studies of Plio-Pleistocene volcanic centers in the Yucca Mountain area. Analog studies of Pliocene volcanic centers in the Fortification Hill field (Lake Mead area, Arizona and Nevada) and the Reveille Range (south-central Nevada) were also used to establish the nature of structural control of volcanic vents and to determine the lengths of volcanic chains. Two high-risk rectangles were constructed at each cluster of Quaternary centers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The scenario in a risk analysis can be defined as the propagating feature of specific initiating event which can go to a wide range of undesirable consequences. If we take various scenarios into consideration, the risk analysis becomes more complex than do without them. A lot of risk analyses have been performed to actually estimate a risk profile under both uncertain future states of hazard sources and undesirable scenarios. Unfortunately, in case of considering specific systems such as a radioactive waste disposal facility, since the behaviour of future scenarios is hardly predicted without special reasoning process, we cannot estimate their risk only with a traditional risk analysis methodology. Moreover, we believe that the sources of uncertainty at future states can be reduced pertinently by setting up dependency relationships interrelating geological, hydrological, and ecological aspects of the site with all the scenarios. It is then required current methodology of uncertainty analysis of the waste disposal facility be revisited under this belief. In order to consider the effects predicting from an evolution of environmental conditions of waste disposal facilities, this paper proposes a quantitative assessment framework integrating the inference process of Bayesian network to the traditional probabilistic risk analysis. We developed and verified an approximate probabilistic inference program for the specific Bayesian network using a bounded-variance likelihood weighting algorithm. Ultimately, specific models, including a model for uncertainty propagation of relevant parameters were developed with a comparison of variable-specific effects due to the occurrence of diverse altered evolution scenarios ({AESs}). After providing supporting information to get a variety of quantitative expectations about the dependency relationship between domain variables and {AESs}, we could connect the results of probabilistic inference from the Bayesian network with the consequence evaluation model addressed. We got a number of practical results to improve current knowledge base for the prioritization of future risk-dominant variables in an actual site.},

	abstract = {This paper summarizes the evolution of the engineered barrier design for the proposed Yucca Mountain disposal system. Initially, the underground facility used a fairly standard panel and drift layout excavated mostly by drilling and blasting. By 1993, the layout of the underground facility was changed to accommodate construction by a tunnel boring machine. Placement of the repository in unsaturated zone permitted an extended period without backfilling; placement of the waste package in an open drift permitted use of much larger, and thus hotter packages. Hence in 1994, the underground facility design switched from floor emplacement of waste in small, single walled stainless steel or nickel alloy containers to in-drift emplacement of waste in large, double-walled containers. By 2000, the outer layer was a high nickel alloy for corrosion resistance and the inner layer was stainless steel for structural strength. Use of large packages facilitated receipt and disposal of high volumes of spent nuclear fuel. In addition, in-drift package placement saved excavation costs. Options considered for in-drift emplacement included different heat loads and use of backfill. To avoid dripping on the package during the thermal period and the possibility of localized corrosion, titanium drip shields were added for the disposal drifts by 2000. In addition, a handling canister, sealed at the reactor to eliminate further handling of bare fuel assemblies, was evaluated and eventually adopted in 2006. Finally, staged development of the underground layout was adopted to more readily adjust to changes in waste forms and Congressional funding.},
