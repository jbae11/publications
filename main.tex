\section{Abstract}
\gls{UNF} repositories, given the high decay heat and radioactivity
of \glspl{UNF}, requires careful engineering. The current plan is
to design a repository that would contain the material for one million years.
Considering various events (failures) can occur in that time range,
the \gls{UNF} repository proposes an interesting subject for
\gls{PRA}. In this report, the model repository design is after the 
Yucca Mountain Repository, which is a mined repository in volcanic tuff.
Ultimate failure status can be defined in various ways, depending on the
extent of leakage during the one million years (leakage from canister
\textasciitilde exposure to nearest population).
A definitive exposure of failure criteria must be defined,
in order for a reasonable analysis.  

Given the expansive
time range, very little real data is available, which makes
most of the probability values a Bayesian, a `degree-of-confidence' value.
Other data can be derived from scientific data, such as 
corrosion and precipitation in the area, but would have to be extrapolated
with assumptions for the given time range.

The failure scenario would begin from the canister's arrival at the
site, namely, from the repackaging facility. The repackaging facility
would take out the individual assemblies from the transportation cask
and emplace the assemblies in a storage cask. There, the storage cask
would be moved to the repository to sit for a million years. 
Given the successful emplacement of the fuel canister, the canister
must corrode, or break, in order to expose the radioactive materials
inside. The exposed radioactive materials would be transported, through
various methods (person carrying it out, precipitation flow etc.)
to affect the population, causing the system to fail.
